/**
 *
 * Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range
 *
 * worst time: n
 * best time: n
 * average time: n
 *
 * amount of memory: equals to the size of the range of numbers plus 1 (for example: 1001 for numbers from 0 to 1000)
 *
 * P.S. The use of counting sort is useful only when the sorted numbers have (or can be mapped to) a range of possible
 * values that is small enough compared to the sorted set, for example, a million natural numbers less than 1000
